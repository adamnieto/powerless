## What is this stuff?
This is fast and tiny set of ZSH scripts providing some nice ZSH setup, including powerline-inspired prompt and some other enhancements. The prompt offers some nice visual experience and information, including Git repositories metadata.

## Installation.
Make sure that you have some powerline-enabled font installed and activated in your terminal emulator.

Just copy the folder containing all the powerless scripts somewhere and then do this:
```bash
source "/path/to/file/powerless.zsh"
```
in your `.zshrc` ZSH script.

Make sure that your `.zshrc` does not contain any code which might conflict with powerless scripts.
